Using

You need some acces tokens in order to use the Twitter API and
authenticate with your account.

_CONSUMER_KEY and _CONSUMER_SECRET are application specific tokens. You'll
have to register a Twitter app to get those. Follow this link:

After doing that, set your account _ACCES_TOKEN_KEY, _ACCES_TOKEN_SECRET
and _USER and you can start using this script.
